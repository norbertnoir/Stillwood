# STILLWOOD

## An Atmospheric Horror Experience

**STILLWOOD** is a prototype for a first-person psychological horror game, built in Unity and rendered with URP. It is a love letter to the golden age of survival horror, drawing inspiration from the lonely, oppressive worlds of *Silent Hill* and the raw, untamed nature of Slavic folklore.

This project currently exists as a "walking simulator" in the most literal sense, but its core purpose is to establish a powerful, foundational atmosphere. The player is invited to explore a vast, hand-crafted mountain environment, from its damp, root-tangled foothills to its windswept, desolate peaks.

### Key Features of the Current Build:

*   **A World That Breathes (and Watches):** The centerpiece of the prototype is a large, multi-layered map designed for vertical exploration. Every path, landmark, and lighting setup is intentionally crafted to evoke feelings of awe, isolation, and creeping dread.

*   **PSX Aesthetic in a Modern Engine:** The game utilizes a custom URP shader to achieve a distinct retro visual style. This is not just a filter; vertex snapping, texture warping, and a limited color palette are used to create a deliberate sense of visual instability, mirroring the protagonist's fragile mental state.

*   **The Stalker AI:** The forest is not empty. A prototype of the main antagonist, the "Leshy," has been implemented. This AI entity does not attack. Instead, it silently stalks the player, appearing at the edge of their vision, between trees, or on distant ridges. Its sole purpose in this build is to create a persistent, unnerving feeling of being hunted.

### Development Goals:

STILLWOOD is envisioned as a full non-combat horror experience. Future development will focus on implementing systems for:
*   Stealth and environmental interaction.
*   A choice-driven narrative where players must confront the forest's ancient guardian.
*   A dynamic "Forest's Respect" system that tracks player actions and determines their fate.
